Government QR payment is a new mode of payment for government digital services and bills. Developed by GovTech, Government QR payment allows citizens to simply scan the QR code on their government bills, both physical and electronic. This eliminates the need to manually enter payment details such as bill reference number and the amount payable, each time a citizen transacts with the Government.

GovTech partnered the industry to enable Government QR payment, and citizens can use any of the payment applications from DBS, OCBC, UOB, NETS as well as PayNow participating bank applications to make payment.

The Government QR payment option is a step towards the Digital Government Blueprint’s goal of delivering end-to-end digital services for citizens by 2023, making transactions more convenient and digital payments easier to use.
