### **Our Culture and Values**

Innovation is a way of life at GovTech. We think big, start small, and learn from failing fast. We have programmes to empower our GovTechies spark collaboration and drive innovative projects for public good. Our Agile, Bold, and Collaborative values unite us from different teams in delivering the business outcomes in a growth-oriented workplace. They drive what we build for our citizens, businesses, and public officers.

We are also committed to build an inclusive and diverse work environment – regardless of gender, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics. This is what makes us do great work.

If you’re passionate about using technology to better lives of Singaporeans, we want you. Together, we can realise our vision, and become a nation of possibilities empowered through technology.
